/**
 * Write a class called InputOrGenerateDiceRolls.

 The program should ask the user whether the user prefers 1)
 to roll his/her own dice, 2) use computer-generated dice rolls,
 or 3) quit the program.  If the user prefers to roll his/her own
 dice, the program should prompt the user to enter
 5 digits in the range from 1-6 separated by spaces in any order with
 duplicates allowed.  However, if the user prefers to
 use computer-generated dice rolls, generate 5 random digits in the range
 from 1-6 with duplicates allowed.
 Next, regardless of the userâ€™s preference, display the 5 digits
 (representing 5 dice rolls) in non-decreasing order.
